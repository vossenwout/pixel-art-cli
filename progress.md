- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Completed T:7 line: added Canvas Line (Bresenham) with endpoint bounds validation and unit tests for horizontal/vertical/diagonal lines plus out_of_bounds errors.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Completed T:8 undo/redo history: added canvas snapshot/restore support plus history manager with undo/redo/redo-clear behavior and unit tests for no_history errors.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Completed T:9 PNG export: added canvas ExportPNG with PNG encoding and unit tests for pixel fidelity + io errors.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Completed T:10 command handler: added daemon handler mapping protocol requests to canvas operations, error mapping, and stop callback support with unit tests.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Completed T:11 socket server: added Unix domain socket server handling one request per connection plus integration tests for newline response and invalid requests.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Completed T:12 PID + stale socket handling: added daemon startup helpers with injectable liveness/dialer checks plus unit tests; includes PID write/cleanup helpers.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Completed T:13 graceful shutdown: added daemon runtime with stop/signal handling, cleanup of PID/socket, and tests for stop request + SIGINT shutdown.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Completed T:14 headless runtime: added `daemon.RunHeadless` wiring canvas/history/server/runtime plus tests for command handling and DISPLAY unset.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Completed T:15 daemon command: added size/scale validation, headless wiring, and CLI tests that start a headless daemon on a temp socket/PID.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Next: implement client transport (T:16) and `pxcli start` command (T:17).
- Completed T:16 client transport: added `internal/client` with request/response handling, timeouts, and structured errors; added tests for ok response, missing socket, and timeout behavior.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Next: implement `pxcli start` (T:17) and CLI command wiring.
- Completed T:17 start command: spawn daemon with validated size/scale/headless flags, wait for socket readiness, print PID, and handle daemon-already-running errors; added unit/integration coverage for start behavior/argv construction.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Completed T:18 stop command: added `pxcli stop` to send stop requests, wait for socket/PID cleanup, and integration tests for stop + missing daemon errors.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Completed T:19 CLI drawing commands: added `set_pixel`, `fill_rect`, `line`, `clear` commands with arg validation, request wiring, and mocked-client unit tests (flags are non-interspersed to allow negative numeric args).
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
