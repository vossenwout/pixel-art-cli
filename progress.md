- Completed T:1 scaffold: Go module, Cobra root command with --version, and unit tests for unknown command/usage and version.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/pxcli` pass.
- Completed T:2 defaults/config: added `internal/config` with shared defaults/options, root `--socket` validation, and stub `start`/`daemon` commands with `--headless` flag; added unit tests for defaults and validation.
- Tests/run: `go test ./...` passes.
- Next: implement IPC protocol parsing (T:3) and begin command/daemon plumbing.
